Statistics:

For the Demo, the CPU Utilization is around 63.1% with the average service time per thread of 28910. The average normalized service time per thread is 0.05. And the program swapped in about 1250 pages and swapped out 270 pages.

For my solution, the CPU Utilization is around 86.2% with the average service time per thread of 24232.8. The average normalized service time per thread is 0.05. And the program swapped in about 1000 pages and swapped out 484 pages.

My laptop's fan roared when I ran the Demo; but it was silent when I ran my solution. 

In other words, the soultion was able to use more CPU to shorten the time it takes memory and threads to do tasks.
